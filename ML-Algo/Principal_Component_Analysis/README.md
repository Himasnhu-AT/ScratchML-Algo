## Principal Component Analysis

### Packages used:

- `Numpy`
- `Pandas`
- `Sklearn`
- `Matplotlib`

### Brief explanation:

An algorithm that reduces the dimensionality of a data set to a lower-dimensional linear subspace by linear projection
in such a way that the reconstruction error made by the linear projection is as
low as possible.

The implementation of Principal Component Analysis on Face Recognition is also present in the repository.
