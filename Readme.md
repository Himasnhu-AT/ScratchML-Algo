# ScratchAI-Algo

ScratchAI-Algo is a a collection of AI/ML algorithms written from scratch in numpy and pandas along with their explanations. It is a collection of algorithms that are implemented in Python. It is a part of the `SynthAI-Labs` project, focused on creating and teaching AI/ML algorithms from scratch.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This repo is for educational purposes only. The algorithms are implemented in a simple and understandable way, so that beginners can understand the concepts behind the algorithms.
> Therefore, The algorithms are not optimized for performance. For optimized and production ready implementations, please use libraries like `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, `pytorch`, etc.

> [!NOTE]
> We are constantly adding new algorithms to this repo. If you have any suggestions or requests, please create an issue.
> Also we are planning to add more detailed explanations and tutorials for each algorithm. Stay tuned! Give it a star :star: if you like the project.
